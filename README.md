<p align="center">This is repository where I will attach my example of checklists</p>

<p align="center">
In the <a href="https://walkme.dog">Walkme App</a> project, I actively created test cases, but not always I had enough time, so, a valuable part of the app is covered by checklists
</p>

All next examples will be provided as screenshots from the Testiny platform that I desired for hodling QA documentation

## Screenshot of Checklists:
Here you can see how I usualy create the checklists. It's how they look in general

## Expanded checklist
Since testing is context-dependent, there are situations when it is appropriate to use extended checklists, as in this case.

## e2e tests
I decided to add the e2e tests, as they are also created as checklists and plays very valuable part in almost every product:

## Additional info: 
Also, I like to use non-atomic checklists or test cases (it means, that these artifacts can have a few expected result)

For example:

Checklist summary
Step 1 | 
Step 2 | 
Step 3 | [Expected result]
Step 4 | [Expected result]
Step 5 | [Expected result]
Attachments
It helps me to better understand the sense of the check, and go faster through the test scope
